# API Lightning Learn Assignment

## Deliverables

- Research API documentation and create a well documented README with example URLS and how the data is consumed in your web app.
- Create a simple one page application that takes in at least 2 seperate endpoints from the api that you choose. 
- Web app must be styled in a way that makes sense with the api you choose. (Be creative! If you're pulling solarsystem infomation make it look like a galaxy!) 
- Be prepared to share with your classmates what you learned while using this api. For example, 

## APIs to Use
This assignment is open for you to explore different APIs and understand how they all can differ. For this web app it will be a simple GET and display the information in a creative fashion. 

Some examples include:

[Air Quality Api](https://docs.openaq.org/)

[Food Api](https://spoonacular.com/food-api)

[Video Api](https://developer.vimeo.com/api/start)

and many other... think of something that you are interested in and look for it! 

Here are some great resources to find APIs quickly by topics.
